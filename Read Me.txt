This Project revolves in the domain of telecommunications where churn rate is the important parameter. 

As google defines churn rate as below: 
Churn rate (sometimes called attrition rate), in its broadest sense, is a measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period. 
It is one of two primary factors that determine the steady-state level of customers a business will support.

The business problem we are to solve here is to predict whether the customer will churn or not. 
By doing this the organization can take measures to retain customers and in turn reduce Customer Attrition.

The data is uploaded in the repository. 

In the given data we have 20 features and 1 Label coloumn which is churn. 

The basic visual analysis and EDA was done in Tableau and the file is uploaded for your reference. 

Then the data cleaning and modelling are done in python and file is added. 

Any suggestions and discussions are most welcomed.
